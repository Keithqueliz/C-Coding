I'm utilizing GitHub as a centralized platform to track the progress of all my assignments. 
By creating dedicated repositories for each task, I can easily manage tasks, monitor changes, and collaborate with peers. 
GitHub's issue tracking, project boards, and version control enable me to maintain transparency and organization throughout the assignment process, 
ensuring efficient progress monitoring and streamlined collaboration.
